        <p>
            How did you even find this? It's a bare HTML site, was it worth it?

        <h2>Get on with it!</h2>
        <p>
            Anyway, this is where I, Daan Jamo de Munck, will be uploading my
            silly WebDev experiments :). At least, until the domain expires.

        <h3>Do you like olives?</h3>
