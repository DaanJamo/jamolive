# Jamo.live

I got this domain name for free, I'm using it and you can't stop me.

## Why, just why?

This will be a proper portfolio site at some point, for now I just want to upload _something_ to my own little corner of the internet.

## What's your techstack?

Plain HTML... No, I'm not using Rust, Deno or Svelte (...yet). Oh, and GitHub Pages, I guess?
